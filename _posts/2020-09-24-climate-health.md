I produced an interactive website using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) to display the results of a [computer-assisted systematic map](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00179-0/fulltext) of the literature on climate change and health. The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/mcc-apsis/climate-health-app).
