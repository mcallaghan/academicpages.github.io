## Introduction

- Scale of Net Zero transition w Paris agreement

- Despite broad support for climate action, progress has been below that required

- Concrete policies are more controversial - discourses of delay, as well as remnants of denial (+ between the two)

- Challenges of energy crisis

- Support for policies, concern about impacts, ..., is primarily expressed in texts

- Texts, twitter, news, parliamentary protocols, scientific papers, are available in online archives, often with high spatial and temporal resolution.

- The project aims to identify different narratives about concern for climate impacts, and support for specific climate actions, and quantify the extent to which these respond to external shocks, such as climate impacts or the current energy crisis.

## Measuring concern for climate action

- Why is this important?

- Current work on understanding concern for climate action

- Data sources, news, news comments, twitter, parlimentarians on twitter, parliamentarians

## Support for climate policy and discourses of delay

- Why is this important?

- Current work on support for policy, mismatch of support and perceived support of others, mismatch between support and concern.

- Current work on strands of delay and denial.

- Measuring these with ML

## Understanding responses to shocks, and the effect of context

- Why is this important?

- Current work on response to climate shocks (weather, boiling frog )

- Other things that can affect concern/support:



# Research outputs

- How did Europe respond to the heatwaves of 2022? To what extent was climate change mentioned in coverage? How does this compare to publics, parliamentarians? How does this compare to previous years?

- The energy price shock. How does this affect support for renewables / nuclear / climate policy?
  - Narratives around Net Zero. Who blames net zero for high gas prices?

- Something around locations of power installations and how this affects things over time

- Experiment testing responses to narratives on twitter

# Requirements

- How many people how long
- Student researchers for coding
- Time plan
