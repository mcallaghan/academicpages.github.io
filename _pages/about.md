I am a researcher at the [Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/) in Berlin.
I study large collections of text about climate change using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

A large part of my work is focussed on developing applications of machine learning that help
researchers produce evidence synthesis about climate change.  

I also work with texts from social media or political debates in order to understand societal discourses around climate change.

I am currently working on

- The intersection of climate and health
- Climate impacts, especially in the context of vulnerability
- Policies and measures to mitigate climate change

I received my PhD from the University of Leeds in 2022.
